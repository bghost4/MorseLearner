UI semi planned out, somewhat functional. sound is clicky and not correct, not sure if it has something to do with tasks or not. tried pre-buffering audio, 
then playing it in one go, as there were many more problems with trying to generate audio on the fly. hopefully this doesn't turn into memory issues although I suspect
it will.
